\subsection{Organization}
The conceptualization process was led by the PIs from University of Southern California,
Georgia Institute of Technology and Rutgers, and guided a steering committee of
leading experts. 
The investigators are renowned experts on future computing platforms applied to
diverse scientific domains and in managing large scale software infrastructure. 
The USC Center for
Advanced Software Technologies, directed by Prasanna, 
and the NSF I/UCRC Center for Hybrid
Multicore Productivity Research, led by Bader, 
provide an available pool of software and technology
resources for the conceptual design. 
The investigators have successful prior collaborations. 
The coordination for the design was achieved though frequent virtual meetings using audio and video
conferencing, shared ``wiki'' sites and document repositories, and discussion lists. 
All materials are open to the steering committee and workshop participants, and will be archived.
